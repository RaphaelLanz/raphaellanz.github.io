### What is Artificial Intelligence?
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. AI technologies aim to mimic human cognitive abilities and enable machines to process and analyze vast amounts of data, adapt to changing circumstances, and perform tasks with varying levels of autonomy. AI encompasses a broad range of subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, and it has applications in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.

### What is prompt?
Prompts are instructions that are given to AI to get a response or to guide their actions. They are used to provide a starting point or a specific focus for a conversation or task. Prompts help to direct the conversation and influence the responses given by the person or system receiving them. They serve as cues or reminders to facilitate communication or action.
