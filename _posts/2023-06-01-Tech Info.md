### What is VPN?
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public network such as the internet. It allows users to establish a private and protected network connection by routing their internet traffic through a remote server operated by the VPN service provider. This helps to safeguard data privacy and security, as the VPN encrypts the transmitted data, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. Additionally, a VPN can help users bypass geographical restrictions, access blocked content, and enhance anonymity by masking their IP address. Overall, a VPN provides a secure and private online experience for users, protecting their data and online activities from potential threats.

### What is a proxy server?
A proxy server is an intermediary server that sits between a user's device and the internet. When a user sends a request for a web page or other online content, the request is first routed to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the user. The proxy server retrieves the requested content and sends it back to the user. This process helps to improve privacy by masking the user's IP address and can also enhance security, cache frequently accessed content for faster retrieval, and provide access to blocked websites or services by appearing as a different location.

### What is Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)?
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity solution designed to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats on endpoints such as desktops, laptops, or servers. EDR solutions monitor and analyze endpoint activities in real-time, collecting data on processes, file changes, network connections, and user behavior. By leveraging advanced detection techniques and behavioral analytics, EDR solutions can identify malicious activities, detect unauthorized access, and mitigate the impact of security incidents. EDR also provides incident response capabilities, allowing security teams to investigate alerts, contain threats, and remediate affected endpoints. With its proactive approach, EDR strengthens an organization's security posture and helps protect against sophisticated cyber threats.
