# What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is a free and highly customizable alternative to commercial operating systems like Windows and macOS. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and it is widely used on various devices, ranging from servers and supercomputers to desktop computers, laptops, and even smartphones.

What sets Linux apart is its open nature, as its source code is freely available to the public. This allows a large and active community of developers to contribute to its development and improvement. Different distributions, or distros, of Linux exist, each with its own set of features and software packages, but they all share the Linux kernel as their core.

Linux provides both a command-line interface and graphical user interfaces, making it accessible to users of different skill levels. It has a vast ecosystem of free and open-source software applications and strong support for networking and server technologies, making it a popular choice for various purposes, including web hosting, cloud computing, and enterprise solutions. Linux has gained popularity due to its stability, security, and the freedom it provides to its users.

### Basics Linux Commands

Linux commands are instructions given to the Linux operating system to perform various tasks or operations. They are typed into a command line interface, also known as a terminal or console, and executed by the system.

Linux commands can be used to manage files and directories, install and update software packages, configure system settings, network management, process management, user management, and much more.

Most Linux commands have specific syntax, options, and arguments that need to be used correctly in order to achieve the desired results. It’s important to understand the basics of Linux commands if you want to use the Linux operating system effectively.
